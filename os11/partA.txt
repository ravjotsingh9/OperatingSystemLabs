For graph between quanta and efficiency:
The efficiency percentage of non blocking process is always higher 
than the blocking because the blocking process may not be always 
able to consume the whole quanta for its execution whereas, the non 
blocking process utilizes the entire quanta without blocking and 
lead to higher efficency.

For the graph between Quanta and Wait time:
As the quanta increases, the waiting time for blocking operation 
increases slower than the non-blocking because the blocking spend 
some time blocked whereas the nonblocking process is continuously 
waiting.

For the graph between Quanta and turn around time:
Turn around time is the sum of total time the process is on CPU, in 
a wait queue or is blocked. Since the blocking process spends an 
additional time in blocked state, it waiting time always remain 
higher than the non blocking process.
