ANSWER:
	On modification to the BSIZE, there is no change in the output 
	in the cases where the sleep time is considerable. But in the
	cases where the sleep time is short, change in BSIZE does shows
	the change in the output. In these cases where the sleep time
	is small,the producer produces consequently till the buffer gets 
	full and consumer consumes consequently till the buffer get empty.

	On reversing the order of the signal instruction and the 
	lock-releasing,there is not any difference in the output with and
	without the sleep time.
	Conceptually ,the reverse order makes more sense as it raise the
	signal after the mutex is unlocked.
